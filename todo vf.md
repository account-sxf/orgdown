# Quick Notes

- SNOW implementation planned for Oct 2021, Sam expects March for replacement of eRemedy, eRemedy Integration intiatives (BMC Remedy) could still be a win prior
  - Andrew believes SNOW will be in within 2021
- Outlook Triage
  - There’s a limitation of concurrent MAPI session for a single mailbox in Outlook client which is 40. For example, if 40 devices are used to connect to this user at the same time, then some outlook sessions may fail as each device connected to this user would generate 2 or more sessions. Do you see any “connecting” in the Outlook status bar
- Splunk (Reporting Web App/Service)
- AWS Connect Stuff
  - My thoughts after UAT:
    - Customer Effort Survey at end of call should be < 3 questions, unbearable at present. May require informing customers and SDM feedback.
    - DONE Quick connect lists: are they coming? can any number be a quick connect? any external?
    - When agent has caller on hold it notifies every 10 seconds. It should be 30 sec or so.
    - eLearning to be done
  - Tony thoughts: Still very consumer focussed / "this is how we do it"
    - Was concerned that SBR wasn't able to be implemented - I confirmed what we have been told and/are planning
    - Consumer based intent codes (mandatory?) / Deceased customer LMAO
  - Pending Activities:
    - Remaining Numbers
    - Faults with call delivery as identified by myself and Joel
    - Missing Promo, Transtasmansales, Verint and Datacentre
    - Ability for historical reporting of Small Customer volumes from day one
    - BCP related configuration / workaround SLA Acceptance
    - Sam is keen for the surveys to be switched on
    - WFM Use or Not Use? Possible processes to minimize/or benefit from the double handling
- WSDL XML eRemedy
  - UAT: http://itsmuat:8080/arsys/shared/login.jsp?/arsys/WSDL/protected/list

- SMF
  - Modular Architecture
  - Police is the biggest customer in SMF
  - S1 are Wellington S2 are auckland
  - Search device name: NMS_.SYT
  - NMS1 is availability
  - NMS2 is capacity mgmt
  - Software upgrades/optimizations are extrememly good value (many have been done/planned by Andrei)
  - Couple of additional ones:
    - WNS5AKN5
    - WNS013
    - WNSYS... more devices
    - WNSYS006
    - WNSYS002 hosts the older php pages
    - WNSMFUI100 java pages (.faces) on this server
    - WNSYS14 dependency (runs mysql and pages require a query to this to work...)
    - Caching takes care of certain outages
    - Database is Oracle 10G - good and reliable, not expected to face more database issues (after a restart after 10 years!)
    - WNSMFDB
    - WNSFMAP100 Main Application Server - Aggregates all streams
    - WNSYS016
  - Andrei came back on board and has corrected all alerting except for a couple of servers to be resolved
    - Restart of main database made a massive improvement
  - Sputnik: all nms' will move to new hyperflex instance
    - Start in earnest (maybe) next 3-4 months
- NOC Roster
  NOC L2 Only
    - E: 11:00 - 19:30
    - L: 11:00 - 19:30
- Daily GTD Prep (morning/or when feeling untethered):
  - Monday only: Check Reporting Roster, update todos
  - Check planner, do any quick tasks, record next task
  - Check Outlook, do any quick tasks, record next task
  - Check Azure, do any quick tasks, record next task
  - Check brain, do any quick tasks, record next task
  - Prioritise TODOs (just order)
  - Start list
- GIT Rebase Strategy
  - Rebasing off latest master:
    - create and move to new branch
    - git rebase origin/master
    - if needed: git origin --delete old_feature_branch
      - This only deletes remote branch
- Interesting Areas of VF
  - Platforms (Dgt Svc & Tools - Pltfms)
    - Kris Thornley (platforms lead)
    - Jeremy West (product owner - AWS Connect)
- Jared Vern and Chris Gadd - Autobots/Auto Ops
  - RPA stuff is used for Email (does have orchestration, but still brittle)
  - Good suggestion: Eliminate email-channel volume other ways (e.g. expose update data)
    - This is more forward thinking, as email is becoming obsolescent
